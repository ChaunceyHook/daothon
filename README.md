# Inspiration

We the people walked through several ETH Global Event found a sad fact: The sustainability of the hackathon projects is low. Those projects are lack of supports from the hackers, the community and the organizers(typically the investor groups in the industry), after each event. Without sustainability, most of the projects become glittering gizmos down to the basement.

The reasons are apparent:

- In typical hackathons, hackers work in only one group, for one project per event, the lack of liquidity of ideas and techniques hinders the ideas' full implementation.
- The community can't follow up with the project's progress or the teams' ideas, which shrank the project's notability in and after each event.
- As the judges may have no sufficient time to measure the potential value of each project, they may tend to select those most 'interesting' projects. Besides, the bounty is more likely a oTne-time prize than a form of consistent funding.

That's why we kicked in with DAOthon, a brand-new platform to solve all those problems in the hackathons. By introducing the <jinzhubaba> into account, we can create an idea-oriented, well-supported hackathon platform with highly-motivated participants and robust sustainability.

# What it does

Our concept is carried out by the platform DAOthon, where the participants post their ideas and abilities freely. By the power of DAO, we can evaluate each participant's contribution and each project's value in a fairway.

In design, for the DAOthon, we initialized these simple ideas to secure our goals:

- A Clear Platform with High Liquidity of Information
- A Robust Mechanism to Evaluate the Projects and People
- A Promised Implementation to raise the sustainability to the Projects and the People
