# Inspiration

We the people walked through several [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.co/) event found a sad fact: The sustainability of the hackathon projects is low. Those projects are lack of supports from the hackers, the community and the organizers(typically the investor groups in the industry), after each event. Without sustainability, most of the projects become glittering gizmos down to the basement.

The reasons are apparent:

- In typical hackathons, hackers work in only one group, for one project per event, the lack of liquidity of ideas and techniques hinders the ideas' full implementation.
- The community can't follow up with the project's progress or the teams' ideas, which shrank the project's notability in and after each event.
- As the judges may have no sufficient time to measure the potential value of each project or investigate the source code, they may tend to select those most 'interesting' projects. Besides, the bounty is more likely a oTne-time prize than a form of consistent funding. All these kind of reasons will lead hackathon project focus more on frontend and surface rather then kernel and algorithm.

That's why we kicked in with DAOthon, a brand-new platform to solve all those problems in the hackathons. By introducing the <jinzhubaba> into account, we can create an idea-oriented, well-supported hackathon platform with highly-motivated participants and robust sustainability.

# What it does

Our concept is carried out by the platform DAOthon, where the participants post their ideas and abilities freely. By the power of DAO, we can evaluate each participant's contribution and each project's value in a fairway.

In design, for the DAOthon, we initialized these simple ideas to secure our goals:

- A Clear Platform with High Liquidity of Information
- A Robust Mechanism to Evaluate the Projects and People
- A Promised Implementation to raise the sustainability to the Projects and the People

This required us to bring new organization of the proces, the role of users, and the overall evaluation of the projects.

## New Categorization of Phase

Let's begin with phase. We apply the technique into the 5 overlaping stages of a hackathon:

- Proposal

  In this stage, the participants can exchange ideas via DAOthon. The Idea Boosters and Carriers can post ideas for the other roles to contribute.

- Matching

  Browsing the ideas, the participants assemble in a functional way, and the liquidity is optimized since the matching process can last for the whole session.

- Voting

  As the DAI is distributed at the first second of an event, the voting process lasts for the whole session. People will vote their interested projects by <> and <>. And people can even short sale the projects, which could make the event more interesting and let people have a brilliant playground to try out their ideas with stablecoins!

- Award

  

- Incubation

## New Categorization of Participants
To evaluate a participant's contribution based on the abilities, we introduced definition of roles as follows. A participant can have multiple roles at one time. The concept of these roles will not only display on the participants' profiles as markers, but also a way of categorizing the contributes in various aspects:

- Connoisseur

The DAO implementation will evaluate each person's contribution, and sum them up as a person's overall abilities.

## New Categorization of Projects



# How we built it

- [Liquidity Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03380)
- [Token Relay](https://github.com/nearprotocol/near-bridge/wiki)
- [Optimistic Rollup](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/optimistic_rollups/)

# Challenges we ran into

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

# What we learned

The extend of a decentralized world is related to the extent of freedom for the people inside, or, the liquidity of the common good. Performing the spirit in various regime is the trend of the era, and we are really into this.

Speaking of the technology, we are very proud of introducing the <jinzhubaba> and <jinzhubaba>'s power. The high accessible toolkits and the ideas under the hood are both very precious.

We also would like to thank everyone who gave us ideas and inspirations, and the best part, the harmonous etherum community, which made our seed to grow.

# What's next

For the project itself -
We'll fullfill the functions and features; but the most important thing is to carry our ideas around - we, as serious hackathon veterans, are eager to communicate our ideas of change to the people in the community, for a better realization of the spirit of a decentralized, high-liquidity world for more and more people.
We are also looking into new contracts and solutions to iterate the product, - we really want it survive and grow.

For our team members -

After this 'impossible assembly',

- Minako will proceed her ambition of the optimized tokenization from matataki and IPFS;
- Yoko will try startup on her own, and seek a solution for those Chinese companys' survival through the hard time;
- Angelika will open up her career in Seattle and devote for some cutting-edge technology;
- Shizuku will go back to University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, for the enternal answer to everthing;
- And I, Iori, will go back to Princeton to feed my cat, Dr. Ginger. Perhaps I'm doing optimizations on compliers in Beijing from May, and the work on the mining contract derivative, honeylemon.market will fruit in April.

So in all, what's next? I don't know. But it will be the future not only for us.
